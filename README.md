# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

The Tinyapp homepage shows the list of available short URLs currently in the database and the corresponding long URLs.

Users must log in before being able to create new short URLs.

Once a new short URL is created, it is shown both on the home page and the users own URL database.
